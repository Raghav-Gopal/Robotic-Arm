## **Robotic Arm**

This is a personal project of mine built under a budget. It is a 5DOF robot under construction. It uses two MG995 servo motors and a NEMA-17 stepper motor.

The main arm driven by the servo has increased torque thanks to the planetary gearbox it attaches to externally. 

The plan right now is to control the robotic arm using an esp-32 using esp-idf and manually control the servo using MCPWM peripheral. 

As soon as the design progresses, more PCB files and platform IO files will be added.

The goal of this project is to use CV and sort regular components such as capacitors, nuts and bolts, screwdrivers etc.

A complementary automated storage system will also be built once enough progress is made on this.
