**Robotic - Arm**

This robotic arm was an upgrade from the previous design, improving its reach and the number of DOf. The entire robot was a personal project and was built in budget. Hence the robot used only servo motors for all the arm actions and one stepper motor to rotate the entire arm. 

Thor's semi-differential mechanism was used at the end effector for the wrist mechanism, and a planetary gearset acts as the torque multiplier for the bottom servo. 

2x - MG995 Servo motors
3x - SG90 Servo motors
1x - NEMA  17 stepper motor
were used in this project.
